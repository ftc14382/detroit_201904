FTC 14382 (CC4H) Detroit 2019 FTC World Championship videos and commentary.

[Match Results detail for Ochoa](https://ftcscores.com/event/l0tzuPzH)

There are no log files because when we stopped using Vuforia, the software started
spamming the log system with messages. The log files are limited in size, so all the good
data was pushed out by the spam.

Our autonomous was designed to act differently depending on whether we start on a crater corner or a depot corner.
For depot corners, we tried to: land, sample, and claim (70 points). For crater corners, we tried to: land, sample, and park (65 points).
With the exception of Q-23 (where we didn't compete) and Q-123 the autonomous code worked as planned.

## Q-10 

Blue Left (depot) auto: 70 (land, sample, claim)


## Q-23

Didn't complete. We lost connectivity to the hub. This is the sort of USB issue that we've seen before. 

It may be due to static discharge. The robot was fine after the phones were rebooted. Unfortunately, the FTA (Field Technical Advisor)
didn't try rebooting the phones.

## Q-43 

Red Left (depot) auto: 70 (land, sample, claim)

## Q-61

Red Right (crater) auto: 65: (land, sample, park)

## Q-95

Blue Left (depot) auto: 70: (land, sample, claim)

## Q-112

Red Right (crater) auto: 65 (land, sample, park)

## Q-123

Blue Left (depot) auto: 45 (land, claim)

We did not sample. It looks like we landed with a slight heading error that was big enough to cause the robot to miss the gold cube.

There was a wireless disconnect during teleop. We didn't have logs, but it is suspected that there was some sort of wireless interference
that caused the disconnect.

## Q-145

Blue Left (depot) auto: 70 (land, sample, claim)

This was very close, only 10 points difference and all of the telop points for our alliance  were scored by our drive team!

## Q-162

Blue Left (depot) auto: 70 (land, sample, claim)
